MarketsandMarkets forecasts that the global transformer oil market is expected to grow from US$1.98 billion in 2015 to US$2.79 billion by 2020 at a CAGR of 7.14% from 2015 to 2020. Spent oil is currently processed at two commercial plants with distinct competitive advantage delivered through very high recoveries (near 100%), producing as new high quality oils at competitive cost and without environmentally harmful emissions. The process also completely eliminates PCBs, a toxic additive banned under international regulations. In 2016 Hydrodec received carbon credit approval from the American Carbon Registry (ACR), enabling its product to be sold with a carbon offset and creating an incremental revenue stream. The Group is now generating carbon offsets through the re-refining of used transformer oil, which would otherwise ordinarily be incinerated or disposed of in an unsustainable manner. This is a highly distinctive feature for the Group, confirming (as far as the Board is aware) Hydrodec as the only oil re-refining business in the world to receive carbon credits for its output.

The Company is developing a pipeline of immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer based on its ImmunoBody and Moditope platforms. The Company's products include SCIB1, SCIB2 and Modi-1. The Company's first cancer vaccine, SCIB1, is being developed for the treatment of melanoma and is in Phase I/II clinical trials. SCIB2 contains multiple T cell epitopes derived from the lung cancer associated antigen NY-ESO-1. It is developed to the point at which the product is defined and ready for further preclinical development as an immunotherapy for any tumor that expresses the NY-ESO-1 antigen. The Company's first Moditope development candidate is Modi-1. Modi-1 consists of two citrullinated vimentin peptides and one citrullinated enolase peptide.","Scancell Holdings plc is developing novel immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer based on its ImmunoBody and Moditope technology platforms. Scancell's first ImmunoBody, SCIB1 is being developed for the treatment of melanoma. Data from the Phase 1/2 clinical trial demonstrate that SCIB1, when used as monotherapy, has a marked effect on tumour load, produces a melanoma-specific immune response and highly encouraging survival trend without serious side effects. In patients with resected disease there is increasing evidence to suggest that SCIB1 may delay or prevent disease recurrence. Scancell's ImmunoBody vaccines target dendritic cells and stimulate both parts of the cellular immune system: the helper cell system where inflammation is stimulated at the tumour site, and the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte or CTL response where immune system cells are primed to recognise and kill specific cells. Pre-clinical data on a combination of SCIB1 or SCIB2 and checkpoint inhibition (blockade of the PD-1 or CTLA-4 immune checkpoint pathways) have shown enhanced tumour destruction and significantly longer survival times than when either treatment was used alone. Scancell has also identified and patented a series of modified epitopes that stimulate the production of killer CD4+ T cells that have the ability to destroy tumours with minimal toxicity. The Directors believe that the Moditope platform could play a major role in the development of safe and effective cancer immunotherapies in the future.",21910000,2008,14,,-5420000,+44 (0)115 823 1863,http://www.scancell.co.uk/
